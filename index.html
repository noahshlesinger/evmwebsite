    <!-- About Us Section -->
    <section id="about">
        <h2>Who are we?</h2>
        <p>We are a community-driven triathlon club. Our mission is to tie together the loose strands of the triathlon community here in the Willamette Valley to create a supportive and motivated group of endurance athletes. </p>

        <h2>Become a Member!</h2>
        <div class="team">
            <h3>Membership is FREE</h3>
            <p> We truly just want to grow the triathlon community and help individuals come together and find like-minded people to workout with at ALL levels. Most of our members are looking for training partners to help make the training more enjoyable and to keep themselves accountable. We work with TEAM Eugene (Master's) to offer swimming help as well as Cyle Way of Life where you can attend workshops, join in on group rides, and get a 10% discount when you need help with your bike. Whether you're brand new to triathlon or a seasoned vet , this is the place for you. You'll get to be a part of a growing triathlon community who will support and encourage your own journey as they pursue their own. Why become a member of this awesome club? You'll receive updated meet-up schedules, access to sponsor discounts, team orders and any group training meet-ups that we organzie. You can also receive personallized training plans and coaching at a disocunted rate from one our coaches. (Note: You don't need to hire one of our coaches in order to be a member.) Why is it free? The answer is simple: Triathlon is already expensive so why should joining a group add to the cost? In the end, we've put together this club as a meeting point for all the individual athletes out seeking a group to be a part of and it's up to you to decide what you want out of the club.  </p>

        <p>Looking for your fastest bike split? If so, you're probably pretty serious about triathlon and looking to take your performance to the next level. If so, consider what bike you're currently riding and if it's keeping you from a slot at the world championship level. One of pros in our club (Noah Shlesinger) start with a company called KU Cycle and claims he wouldn't switch bikes even if they paid him to. If you're curious about KU Cycle and want to learn more, contact us below and we'll get you connected with Noah.</p>
